I used to use <a href="https://github.com/jamiejackherer/python3-wget" target="_blank">python3-wget</a>
to fetch remote files if I needed to save them to my filesystem from Python code.

Anymore, I am finding that urllib and shutil used together will do the trick:

```{python}
import os
import shutil
import urllib
import urllib.request


def download(url, tofile=None):
    """Fetch a file from `url` and save it to `tofile`.
    """
    if tofile is None:
        tofile = os.path.basename(urllib.parse.urlparse(url).path)
    with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response, open(tofile, "wb") as outfile:
        shutil.copyfileobj(response, outfile)
    return tofile
```
