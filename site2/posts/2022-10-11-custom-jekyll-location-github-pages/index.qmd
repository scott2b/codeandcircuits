If you move the root of your Jekyll project to a subdirectory of a Github Pages enabled
repository, you will need to be sure to change the `source` and `destination` locations
for the `jekyll-build-pages` action accordingly.

But, that's not all. It is not obvious, but you also need to specify the path to the
`upload-pages-artifact` action. Failure to do this will result in a GitHub Actions
build fail for the "Uplodad artifact" stage, with the error message:
"Error: Process completed with exit code 2" (see screenshot below).

The reason this configuration requirement is not obvious is because the path
parameter is not defined in the auto-generated Action config that GitHub gives you
for Jekyll pages, but instead utilizes the
[default value of ./\_site](https://github.com/actions/jekyll-build-pages/blob/main/action.yml#L12).
To specify the path, use the `with > path` syntax.


For example, I have moved my Jekyll root to a location called `site`. Thus, the `jobs`
section of my `.github/workflows/pages.yml` looks like this, (with special attention
paid to the `jekyll-build-pages`, and the `upload-pages-artifact` actions):


```yaml
jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v2
      - name: Build with Jekyll
        uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1
        with:
          source: ./site/
          destination: ./site/_site
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
        with:
          path: ./site/_site
```
