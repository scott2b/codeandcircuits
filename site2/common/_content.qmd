## System Transfer Function {.section}

The transfer function $H(s)$ for a second-order system is:

$$H(s) = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}$$

where:

- $\zeta$ is the damping ratio
- $\omega_n$ is the natural frequency

## Response Types {.section}

The system exhibits three characteristic behaviors:

1. **Underdamped** ($\zeta < 1$)
   - System oscillates with decreasing amplitude
   - Common in systems with insufficient damping

2. **Critically Damped** ($\zeta = 1$)
   - Fastest return to steady state without oscillation
   - Optimal for many control applications

3. **Overdamped** ($\zeta > 1$)
   - Returns to steady state without oscillation
   - Slower response than critically damped
