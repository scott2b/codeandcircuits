I"><p>Here is a rough outline of how my content makes its way to publication.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Obsidian for idea gathering and note-taking</p>

    <p>My primary knowledge management system is <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. The main
 features that I find useful in Obsidian are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Markdown based note-taking</li>
      <li>Links between notes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Obsidian is pleasant to use, but I think it does target a bit more of a technical
 user base than, say, Notion or Evernote. <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> is a popular
 Obsidian competetor that I have not tried.</p>

    <p>I may eventually post more about how I use Obsidian, but there is no shortage of PKM
 (Personal Knowledge Management) pundits fan-blogging about Obsidian.</p>
