Here is a rough outline of how my content makes its way to publication.

1. Obsidian for idea gathering and note-taking

    My primary knowledge management system is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The main
    features that I find useful in Obsidian are:
    - Markdown based note-taking
    - Links between notes


    Obsidian is pleasant to use, but I think it does target a bit more of a technical
    user base than, say, Notion or Evernote. [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) is a popular
    Obsidian competetor that I have not tried.

    I may eventually post more about how I use Obsidian, but there is no shortage of PKM
    (Personal Knowledge Management) pundits fan-blogging about Obsidian.
